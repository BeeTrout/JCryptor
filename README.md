# JCryptor
Quick &amp; simple Java encryptor. Encrypts and decrypts files acording to a integer key.


### How encrypt a file
- Choose if you want to encrypt or decrypt a file.
- Choose an integer key *(whole number between `-2147483648` and `2147483647`)*  **Do NOT use key `0`**.
- You can also chose a random one by pressing the button.
- Remember this key. It will also by used while decrypting the files.
- Enter the file path.
- Press start and your file will be encrypted
##### Decrypting is the same. Just switch to *"Decrypt"* and enter the key you used

### Java version
JCryptor is compiled using `JDK 16`

### Bugs and bad design

If you find some bugs, feel free to write them to [Issues](https://github.com/BeeTrout/JCryptor/issues).

Also the design is awful, Iâ€™ll work on that later.
